This project is a React application that provides an editable layout where you can customize various sections of the webpage, such as the Hero, Features, and About sections. It uses `ReactQuill` for rich text editing and allows you to change background colors and images dynamically. The layout is responsive and designed for quick previews and customizations.

## Features
- **Rich Text Editor**: Uses `ReactQuill` for editing text content in the Hero, Features, and About sections.
- **Background Customization**: Dynamically change the background color of sections (Whole background, Hero background, Features background, and About background).
- **Image Customization**: Set custom images for the Hero section.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout adjusts based on the screen size for a better user experience.
- **Local Storage**: Saves the content and customization settings locally, so the changes persist across page reloads.
